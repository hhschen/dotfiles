# 🌱 Dotfiles Configuration

Welcome to my dotfiles – the setup that powers my daily development workflow, built primarily for Arch Linux with optional Ubuntu support.

This repo contains configuration files, helper scripts, and UI tweaks for a consistent and efficient developer environment across systems.

## 🖥️ Platform

- **OS**: Arch Linux (daily driver), Ubuntu (sidekick)
- **Machine**: ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 6

## 🧰 What's Inside?

Here's a sneak peek into my curated setup:

- **Git** – `.gitconfig`, `.gitignore` for clean commits and global sanity
- **Zsh** –  with aliases, plugins, and productivity hacks
- **Ghostty** – Snappy and styled terminal emulator with a custom config
- **Alacritty** – Secondary terminal emulator with some basic config
- **Neovim** – Lua-configured `init.lua`, plugin ecosystem tailored for speed
- **Vim** – Legacy setup, still usable and customized
- **Tmux** – Tiling terminal multiplexing wizardry 🧙‍♂️
- **Yazi** – A fast and minimal file manager config
- **Zed** – Keybindings and tweaks for a lightweight coding flow (testing)
- **VS Code** – Custom keymaps and user settings
